		I'm Ian Shin, an undergraduate student attending the University of Texas at Austin studying Computer Science. 
		I enjoy learning new concepts in computer science, building cool new projects, hackathons, and solving interesting problems.
		Some of my interests include machine learning and the intersections between machine learning and biology or space exploration. 
		I am especially passionate about using computer science to better my community and the world through any possible means, 
		whether it be through teaching coding or building projects to better people's lives. 
	</p>
	<p>
		I am currently an undergraduate student researcher for the <a href="https://cvcweb.oden.utexas.edu/cvcwp/">Computational Visualization Center</a>
		at the Oden Institute for Computational Engineering and Sciences working under Professor Chandrajit Bajaj, 
		where my team is attempting to model the SARS-CoV-2 virus (COVID-19) spike protein using deep learning. <br />
		This summer, I've also been working as a summer intern at a startup called Mettle Works under former Edmodo CEO Vibhu Mittal 
		creating a product that can extract interesting trends and useful insights from unsorted tabular data. 
	</p>
	<p>
		Previously, I worked at Carnegie Mellon University's Human-Computer Interaction Institute as a summer research intern with the ClassInSight project,
		during which I developed new functionalities such as data deletion for the user's interface and improving the developers' dashboard via new tools for navigation.
	</p>
	<p>
		In my free time, I enjoy spending time with friends, driving, updating my Spotify playlists, Wikipedia surfing, or napping.
