			I'm Ian Shin, an undergraduate student attending the University of Texas at Austin as a Computer Science major. 
			I enjoy learning new concepts in computer science, building cool new projects, attending hackathons, and solving interesting problems.

			I am passionate about using computer science to better my community and the world through any means, 
			whether it be through teaching coding or building projects aimed at improving people's lives; 
			I am also interested in learning about the intersections between machine learning and biology or space exploration. 
		</p>
		<p>
			I am currently an undergraduate researcher assistant for the <a href="https://cvcweb.oden.utexas.edu/cvcwp/">Computational Visualization Center</a>
			at the Oden Institute for Computational Engineering and Sciences under Professor Chandrajit Bajaj, 
			where my team is hard at work learning to fold proteins using deep reinforcement learning along with tools such as AMBER. <br />
			This summer, I've also been working as a summer intern at the startup Mettle Works under former Edmodo CEO Vibhu Mittal 
			creating a product that can extract interesting trends and useful insights from unsorted tabular data. 
		</p>
		<p>
			Previously, I worked at Carnegie Mellon University's Human-Computer Interaction Institute as a summer research intern with the 
			<a href="https://www.hcii.cmu.edu/research/classinsight">ClassInSight</a> project,
			during which I developed new functionalities such as data deletion for the user's interface and improving the developers' dashboard via new tools for navigation.
		</p>
		<p>
			In my free time, I enjoy spending time with friends, driving, 
			updating my <a href="https://open.spotify.com/user/ians1780?si=Vgm8-fXNS7K3WHTdXirt_w">Spotify playlists</a>, Wikipedia surfing, and napping. 
		</p>
		<p>
			I am currently looking for Summer 2021 internship positions. Here is my <a href="resume/resume.pdf">resume</a> -- if you want contact me, please send me an email.
